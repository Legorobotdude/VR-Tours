This project aims to provide an open source implementation of a Virtual Reality tour, with easily customizable custom setup for informational popups.

VR-Tours is an open source framework that lets users create a virtual reality tour
or training simulation using a set of scripts and pre-built objects. It simplifies the 
VR scripting interface into a drap-and-drop development style making it easier than ever
to make a VR simulation of your own.

This project includes the files for a safety tour of the UIUC ECE Open Lab, with informational popups of all the important safety devices that a user needs to be aware of before being allowed access to the lab. With this virtual tour, users would no longer have to schedule a physical tour and could instead take it virtually on their own time.

# Usage

You can use this toolkit to develop VR tours of homes, tourist attractions, and other locations. You can also use this 
framework to build a training application in VR to perform things like safety training for a lab or training to use a specific tool.

# Build/Installation Instructions

## Unity
To develop applications using the toolkit, you can install the 2018.3 version of Unity or any other version compatible with 2018.3
and open up the repository as a Unity project.

## VRTK
Get the VRTK dependencies from https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK and import them into your project.

## VR SDKs
