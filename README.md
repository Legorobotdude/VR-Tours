# VR-Tours

This project aims to provide an open source implementation of a Virtual Reality tour, with easily customizable custom setup for informational popups.

This project includes the files for a safety tour of the UIUC ECE Open Lab, with informational popups of all the important safety devices that a user needs to be aware of before being allowed access to the lab. With this virtual tour, users would no longer have to schedule a physical tour and could instead take it virtually on their own time.
